# Python-Learning
This repository serves as a documentation of my journey into **Computer Science** and **Python** programming as a Computer Engineering student. Here, you will find my learning steps, daily coding exercises, notes, algorithmic solutions, and mini-projects designed to build a strong foundation. My primary goal is to master Python syntax, Data Structures, and OOP principles to pave the way for my future studies in **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**.
